# SevenSeg595 Library
=====================

A simple Arduino library for driving 7-segment displays using the SN74HC595 shift register.

## Overview
------------

This library provides a simple way to drive 7-segment displays using the SN74HC595 shift register.
It supports both common anode and common cathode displays.

## Features
------------

* Supports both common anode and common cathode 7-segment displays
* Easy to use API for displaying digits and characters
* Compatible with Arduino boards

## Installation
------------

To install the library, simply download the `SevenSeg595` folder and place it in your Arduino libraries directory.

## Usage
-----

### Connecting the Hardware

To use the library, you will need to connect the SN74HC595 shift register to your Arduino board and the 7-segment display. The connections are as follows:

* SN74HC595 pin 15 (Qa) to 7-segment display Segment A
* SN74HC595 pin 1 (Qb) to 7-segment display pin Segment B
* SN74HC595 pin 2 (Qc) to 7-segment display pin Segment C
* SN74HC595 pin 3 (Qd) to 7-segment display pin Segment D
* SN74HC595 pin 4 (Qe) to 7-segment display pin Segment E
* SN74HC595 pin 5 (Qf) to 7-segment display pin Segment F
* SN74HC595 pin 6 (Qg) to 7-segment display pin Segment G
* SN74HC595 pin 7 (Qh) to 7-segment display pin Decimal Point
* SN74HC595 pin 8 (GND) to GND
* SN74HC595 pin 9 (Qh') to DataIn of the next driver (optional, for cascading display only)
* SN74HC595 pin 10 (SRCLR) to VCC
* SN74HC595 pin 11 (SRCLK) to Arduino Clock
* SN74HC595 pin 12 (RCLK) to Arduino Latch
* SN74HC595 pin 13 (OE') to Arduino OutputEnable
* SN74HC595 pin 14 (SER) to Arduino Data(Out to SN74HC595 DataIn)
* SN74HC595 pin 16 (VCC) to VCC (5V max)
